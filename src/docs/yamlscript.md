# YAMLScript

## Next-Generation YAML

YAMLScript is the future of YAML, extending the language with powerful
programming capabilities while maintaining backward compatibility with
existing YAML 1.2.

## What is YAMLScript?

YAMLScript is a superset of YAML that adds programming language features
to the familiar YAML syntax, enabling you to write executable YAML
documents.

### Key Features
- **Backward Compatible** - All existing YAML 1.2 documents work unchanged
- **Programming Capabilities** - Functions, variables, loops, and conditionals
- **Data Processing** - Transform and manipulate YAML data programmatically
- **Template System** - Generate dynamic YAML content
- **Performance** - Optimized execution for large documents

## Why YAMLScript?

### Current Limitations
Traditional YAML has limitations for complex use cases:

- **Static Content** - No dynamic generation capabilities
- **Repetition** - Manual duplication of similar structures
- **Validation** - Limited runtime validation and transformation
- **Integration** - Difficult to integrate with external data sources

### YAMLScript Solutions
YAMLScript addresses these limitations:

- **Dynamic Generation** - Create YAML content programmatically
- **DRY Principle** - Eliminate repetition through functions and loops
- **Runtime Validation** - Validate and transform data at execution time
- **External Integration** - Connect to databases, APIs, and services

## Use Cases

### Infrastructure as Code
Generate complex Kubernetes configurations dynamically:

```yaml
# Generate multiple similar deployments
deployments:
  for service in services:
    - apiVersion: apps/v1
      kind: Deployment
      metadata:
        name: ${service.name}
        labels:
          app: ${service.name}
      spec:
        replicas: ${service.replicas}
        selector:
          matchLabels:
            app: ${service.name}
```

### Configuration Management
Create dynamic application configurations:

```yaml
# Environment-specific configuration
config:
  database:
    host: ${env.DB_HOST}
    port: ${env.DB_PORT}
    credentials: ${load_secrets('db')}
  
  features:
    for feature in features:
      ${feature.name}: ${feature.enabled}
```

### Data Processing
Transform and validate YAML data:

```yaml
# Process and validate user input
users:
  for user in input_users:
    if validate_user(user):
      - name: ${user.name}
        email: ${user.email}
        role: ${determine_role(user.permissions)}
```

## Language Features

### Variables and Expressions
```yaml
# Define and use variables
vars:
  company_name: "Acme Corp"
  api_version: "v1"
  
config:
  company: ${company_name}
  version: ${api_version}
  timestamp: ${now()}
```

### Functions
```yaml
# Define reusable functions
functions:
  generate_id: |
    function(name, type) {
      return "${type}_${name}_${uuid()}"
    }
  
  validate_email: |
    function(email) {
      return email.matches(/^[^@]+@[^@]+\.[^@]+$/)
    }
```

### Control Flow
```yaml
# Conditional and loop constructs
services:
  for service in service_list:
    if service.enabled:
      - name: ${service.name}
        config: ${service.config}
    else:
      - name: ${service.name}
        status: "disabled"
```

### Error Handling
```yaml
# Robust error handling
try:
  config: ${load_config()}
catch error:
  config: ${default_config()}
  log: "Failed to load config: ${error.message}"
```
