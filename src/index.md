Welcome to the official home of YAML - the human-readable data serialization
language that powers modern technology infrastructure.

YAML processes **millions of deployments daily** across Kubernetes clusters,
CI/CD pipelines, application configurations, and infrastructure as code.

## Why YAML Matters

YAML is the backbone of modern DevOps and cloud-native technologies:

- **Kubernetes** - Every pod, service, and configuration
- **CI/CD** - Pipeline definitions and deployment scripts
- **Infrastructure as Code** - Terraform, Ansible, and more
- **Application Configs** - Environment variables and settings
- **API Definitions** - OpenAPI/Swagger specifications

## Enterprise Sustainability

Critical YAML infrastructure needs professional maintenance and support.
That's why we created the **YAML Enterprise Sustainability (YES) program**.
